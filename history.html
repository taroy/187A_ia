            <h2>Southwestern Louisiana Industrial Institute (SLII)</h2>
     
             <p>UL Lafayette was originally named the Southwestern Louisiana Industrial Institute (SLII),
             according to the 1898 legislative act that created the school.
             State Senator Robert Martin, for whom UL Lafayette's administrative building is named,
             authored this legislation. Several towns competed to be the site of the new school;
             Lafayette was chosen by virtue of a donation of 25 acres of land by the Girard family.
             The town also put up $8,000 and offered a ten-year property tax to supplement state appropriations.
             By 1899, the Board of Trustees was established. In 1900 construction began and Dr. Edwin Stephens
             was named president. Classes began in 1901 with 100 students.</p>
    
            <p>Stephens, then 27 years old, was among the youngest presidents in the nation, and yet he had a vision for the
            campus from his first year. He planted a grove of live oaks, the Twentieth Century Oaks,
            in the first year of the century. Today many of those trees loom over Johnston Street and University Avenue.
            Stephens later founded the national Live Oak Society, an association whose members were the trees themselves
            with dues of 25 acorns a year. UL Lafayette remained an industrial institute until 1921.
            During those years, the campus extended its academic offerings to teacher training by adding a laboratory school
            in 1909. When railways became a force in the area, training began in railroad service.
            Courses in agriculture, stenography, accounting, mechanics, and many liberal arts disciplines were added.
            Among UL Lafayette's early milestones were the formation of the UL Lafayette Alumni Association in 1904
            and publication of the first issue of the Vermilion, the student paper, that same academic year.
            One very early graduate, Jefferson Caffery, would eventually become a legend within the U.S. diplomatic corps.
            Caffery became known as the "Dean of U.S. Diplomats" and served as ambassador to France, Brazil,
            and Egypt during the middle decades of the 20th century. Another alumnus distinguished himself in sports.
            After setting many school records, Keener Cagle played for Army and won the award that would later be known
            as the Heisman Trophy.</p>
